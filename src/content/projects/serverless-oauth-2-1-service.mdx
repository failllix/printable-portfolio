## Motivation

Having used numerous OAuth-protected APIs myself, I became interested in the underlying mechanics and decided the best way to truly understand it was to build my own implementation.
However, diving into the original OAuth 2.0 specification revealed a complex landscape familiar to many developers: numerous grant types, implementation variations, and potential security pitfalls.
During this exploration, I encountered the emerging OAuth 2.1 specification.

It deprecates less secure flows and promotes a more streamlined, secure approach.
This sparked my interest and I decided to use the [ongoing RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12) as guidance for my implementation.
You can find a summary of key differences in [oauth.net's OAuth 2.1 article](https://oauth.net/2.1/).

## Features

### Authorization Code Flow

This project implements a fully functional OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server.
It exclusively supports the Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).
This flow is widely considered the most secure option for web and mobile applications, preventing authorization code interception attacks.

The flow looks like the following:

1. A third-party application (the "client") requests access to protected resources on behalf of a user.
1. The client initiates the authorization request, redirecting the user to the authorization server.
1. The user authenticates with the authorization server (e.g., username/password) and explicitly approves the client's requested access permissions (scopes).
1. Upon successful authentication and approval, the user is redirected back to the client with a temporary authorization code.
1. The client securely exchanges this authorization code (along with the PKCE code verifier) for an access token.

### User Information Endpoint

Empowering users means giving them visibility and control over their granted permissions.
Once authenticated with the authorization server, users can access the `/me` endpoint.
This endpoint provides a detailed overview of their active grants, associated access codes, and refresh tokens.

          "Active": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ```

Crucially, this endpoint is not just informational it provides direct control.
Users can choose to deactivate specific refresh tokens (preventing that instance from getting new access tokens) or entire grants (blocking the client application completely) by sending corresponding `DELETE` requests.

### Convenience Development Helper

Because setting up clients, users, and API definitions can be tedious, the project includes several convenience helper scripts to streamline the configuration process.
They work as simple CLIs that prompt for information and create the corresponding database records.
This way new clients, user and APIs can be added easily.
For more information, refer to the [configuration instructions of the project](https://github.com/failllix/serverless-oauth-2-1-service?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration).

## Architecture

### Serverless

The authorization server's backend uses [Cloudflare Workers®](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) as serverless platform.
I wanted to develop this application in a cloud-native serverless environment and chose Cloudflare Inc. as the infrastructure provider, because of their good documentation, ease of use and generous free tier.
I opted to solely use standard JavaScript utilities (including the [Web Crypto APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API)) to avoid unnecessary building and bundling steps.

The dummy application, which shows token details after successful authorization, and the login page are both run using [Cloudflare Pages™](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

Although the backend logic (Cloudflare Workers®) and the user-facing login page (Cloudflare Pages™) are technically decoupled, serving them from the same domain ensures a seamless user experience.

### Persistence

I initially started using Cloudflare Workers® KV (a key-value store) to persist access codes, tokens, client information.
I thought that entities are not dependent and can be contained in individual buckets.
Simple relationships were managed by storing relevant IDs, for example, linking a refresh token to a grant.

However, towards the end of the project I decided to implement the [user information endpoint](#user-information-endpoint).
This raised a new data retrieval requirement, as I now needed to be able to, for example, retrieve _all_ refresh tokens of a user.
While user information is saved as part of the refresh token, the token itself is only retrievable by the its id.
My initial solution involved redundant storage (storing entities by both ID and a user-prefixed key) to enable `list` operations based on username.
However, this approach quickly became cumbersome during implementation, increasing complexity during updates/deletions, because both indices had to be managed.

This challenge highlighted the limitations of a key-value store.
Consequently, I migrated the persistence layer to [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/), Cloudflare's serverless SQLite database.
D1 offers the benefits of a relational model, simplifying complex queries and relationship management, while integrating seamlessly with Cloudflare Workers®.

## Possible Extensions

While I consider the project done for the time being, I have the following ideas floating in mind, which could be picked up in the future:

1. **Management dashboard:**
   - An administration interface for easier onboarding of clients, users, and APIs
   - A user-friendly dashboard leveraging the `/me` endpoint for managing grants and tokens
1. **Additional grant types:** For example `client_credentials` for technical access
1. **API tests:** Supplementing the existing unit tests with comprehensive E2E integration tests to validate system behavior from the outside
1. **Resource server:** Building a sample resource server that performs access token validation and serves protected resources, completing the end-to-end OAuth flow demonstration
