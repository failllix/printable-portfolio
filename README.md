# Printable Portfolio

## ðŸ’¡ Idea

Inspired by the CV of [Bartosz Jarocki](https://cv.jarocki.me/) I wanted to implement my next portfolio page in a similar manner while giving it my own spin.

The page is focused around printability (as the name of the repository implies) with the idea that the page also represents one's latest CV.
A PDF of the CV can be generated any time by printing the page. The layout is kept simple to improve readability, clarity and accessibility.

## ðŸš€ Technology

As the site can be considered fully static, I opted to use [Astro.js](https://astro.build/).
For styling I have used [tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The site is available at [felix-pruente.de](https://www.felix-pruente.de/) and is deployed using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

## ðŸ’» Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project:

| Command           | Action                                      |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------ |

| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321` |
